This module allows a GM to define custom Ability Scores and Skills for the dnd5e system. The goal is to allow other alternative rulesets to be configured in this module as well.

## Compatibility

I'm honestly not sure how well this will play with modules that make changes to how journal articles or roll tables interact.
